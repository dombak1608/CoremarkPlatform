This is an educational purpose project where you can learn how to port [Coremark](https://www.eembc.org/coremark/) to your microcontroller. 
The idea behind this project is to have a large number of ported microcontrollers which will help a new user to learn how to port their own microcontroller.

In this project you will learn:</br>
<b>[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))</b> - build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code</br>
<b>[Systick](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0179b/ar01s02s08.html)</b> - internal functionality of your MCU to count clocks</br>
<b>[Uart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)</b> - protocol for reading the results on your PC </br>
</br>
