This is an educational purpose project where you can learn how to port Coremark to your microcontroller. 
The idea behind this project is to have a large number of ported microcontrollers which will help a new user to learn how to port their own microcontroller.

In this project you will learn:</br>
<b>Make</b> - build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code</br>
<b>Systick</b> - internal functionality of your MCU to count clocks</br>
<b>Uart</b> - protocol for reading the results on your PC </br>
</br>
