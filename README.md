This is an educational purpose project where you can learn how to port your Coremark to your microcontroller. 
The idea behind this project is to have a large number of ported microcontrollers which will help a new user to learn how to port their own microcontroller.

In this project you will learn:
Make - build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code
Systick - internal functionality of your MCU to count clocks
Uart- protocol for reading the results on your PC
